Who Am I?
=========

I'm a curious tinkerer who likes to play with:

* |ðŸ”§| **Technology** - Because who doesn't love when things *actually* work?
* |ðŸ§ª| **Chemistry** - It's like cooking, but with more safety goggles, and don't lick the spoon. 
* |ðŸŒ±| **Bonsai** (hopefully soon!) - Tiny trees are just regular trees that got ctrl-minus'd.

.. |ðŸŒ±| unicode:: U+1F331 .. seedling
