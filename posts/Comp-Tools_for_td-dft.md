## Abstract

This work presents a collection of computational tools developed for the systematic study of chromophore excited states using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). The suite consists of three Python scripts that automate the workflow of chromophore analysis: geometry optimization, TD-DFT calculations, and visualization of spectral data. These tools leverage the Psi4 quantum chemistry package to enable efficient prediction of excitation energies and oscillator strengths with minimal user intervention. We demonstrate the capabilities of this toolset using a simple test case of urea, highlighting the potential for extension to more complex chromophore systems relevant to materials science and photochemistry. The computational approach described here provides a foundation for future high-throughput screening of chromophores with tailored optical properties.

## Introduction

Chromophores, the molecular substructures responsible for light absorption, play a critical role in numerous applications ranging from photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes to biological imaging and photodynamic therapy[@Marques2012]. Understanding their excited state properties is essential for rational design of new materials with specific optical characteristics. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) has emerged as a powerful method for calculating excited states of medium to large molecules due to its favorable balance between computational cost and accuracy[@Laurent2013].

However, implementing a complete workflow for chromophore analysis—from initial structure to spectral visualization—often requires significant expertise in computational chemistry and script development. The tools presented here aim to streamline this process by providing a coherent set of Python scripts that guide users through the typical stages of chromophore computational analysis: geometry optimization, excited state calculations, and spectral visualization.

The development of automated computational workflows is particularly important in the field of chromophore research, where the ability to rapidly predict and compare optical properties can significantly accelerate the discovery of new functional materials[@Jacquemin2009]. By reducing the technical barriers to computational analysis, these tools can help bridge the gap between experimental and theoretical studies of chromophores.

In this work, we introduce three Python scripts designed to work together as a comprehensive toolkit for chromophore analysis: `optimize.py` for geometry optimization, `td_dft.py` for TD-DFT calculations, and `plot.py` for spectral visualization. Each script is designed with user-friendliness in mind, requiring minimal input while providing detailed output for further analysis.

## Experimental

The computational workflow consists of three main Python scripts that interface with the Psi4 quantum chemistry package:

### Geometry Optimization Script (`optimize.py`)

The geometry optimization script automatically prepares and performs quantum chemical calculations to find the minimum energy structure of a chromophore. This is a critical first step for any excited state calculation, as the accuracy of predicted spectra depends strongly on the quality of the underlying geometry. The script accepts molecular structures in various formats, handles the setup of appropriate computational parameters, and outputs the optimized geometry for subsequent TD-DFT calculations.

The `optimize.py` script provides several important functionalities for the initial phase of chromophore analysis. It automates the setup of directory structures necessary for organizing input and output files, ensuring that results are systematically stored for later access. The script integrates seamlessly with Psi4 to perform B3LYP/6-31G(d) geometry optimization, a method that offers a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for organic molecules. Throughout the optimization process, detailed logging is maintained to track convergence behavior and computational parameters. Upon completion, the script generates optimized structures in a format that is directly compatible with subsequent TD-DFT calculations, eliminating the need for manual file conversion or reformatting.

### TD-DFT Calculation Script (`td_dft.py`)

The TD-DFT script takes the optimized geometry from the previous step and performs excited state calculations using time-dependent density functional theory. It allows users to specify various parameters such as the functional, basis set, number of excited states, and memory allocation. The script is designed to overcome challenges in TD-DFT calculations by implementing multiple approaches to ensure successful completion.

The `td_dft.py` script serves as the core computational component of the workflow, offering comprehensive support for various DFT functionals and basis sets to accommodate different research requirements and accuracy needs. To enhance calculation robustness, the script implements multiple approaches for configuring TD-DFT parameters, allowing it to adapt to the computational challenges that often arise in excited state calculations. Once calculations are complete, the script automatically extracts relevant data such as excitation energies and oscillator strengths from the Psi4 output. Results are provided in both human-readable formats for immediate inspection and CSV format for subsequent analysis or integration with other software, facilitating a seamless analytical workflow from quantum calculations to data interpretation.

### Spectral Visualization Script (`plot.py`)

The spectral visualization script processes the output from TD-DFT calculations to generate publication-quality plots of absorption spectra. It converts the discrete excitation data into continuous spectra by applying Gaussian broadening, which better represents the experimental reality of spectroscopic measurements.

The `plot.py` script completes the analytical pipeline by transforming computational results into visual representations of spectral properties. The script provides flexible input options, allowing users to specify data sources either by molecule name or direct file path, accommodating different organizational preferences and workflow integration needs. It automates the generation of absorption spectra by applying appropriate Gaussian broadening to discrete transition data, producing continuous spectral profiles that more closely resemble experimental measurements. The resulting plots are rendered at publication quality with proper axis labels, legends, and resolution settings, ready for inclusion in scientific manuscripts. Furthermore, the script includes normalization capabilities that facilitate comparative analysis across different chromophore systems, enabling structure-property relationship studies and trend identification in series of related compounds.

All calculations were performed on a Linux system (Ubuntu noble/24.04) with Miniconda to manage Python dependencies, ensuring reproducibility across different computing environments.

## Results and Discussion

[This section would normally contain actual results, but as requested, I'll keep it as a placeholder.]

The effectiveness of our computational toolkit was demonstrated through the analysis of urea as a simple test case. The geometry optimization performed by `optimize.py` successfully produced a minimum energy structure, which was then used as input for TD-DFT calculations. The `td_dft.py` script calculated the excited states using B3LYP/6-31G(d), resulting in a spectrum that was visualized using the `plot.py` script.

The workflow was designed to be easily adaptable to other chromophore systems, providing a foundation for more extensive studies of structure-property relationships. Future work will focus on applying this toolkit to systematically investigate a range of chromophores relevant to organic electronics and photovoltaics.

## Conclusion

The suite of computational tools presented in this work offers a streamlined approach to the analysis of chromophore excited states using TD-DFT. By automating the workflow from geometry optimization to spectral visualization, these tools reduce the technical barriers to computational analysis and facilitate more rapid exploration of chromophore properties.

The modular design of the toolkit allows for easy adaptation to different research questions and integration with other computational approaches. Future developments may include extensions to handle more complex chromophore systems, incorporation of solvent effects, and integration with machine learning approaches for high-throughput screening of candidate chromophores.

This computational approach provides a valuable complement to experimental studies of chromophores, offering insights into the electronic structures underlying observed optical properties and guiding the rational design of new materials for specific applications. By making these tools openly available, we hope to contribute to the broader community effort to understand and develop novel chromophore-based materials for applications in optoelectronics, sensing, and energy conversion.
