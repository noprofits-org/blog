# Site Colophon

## Technical Stack
This blog is built using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), a static site generator written in Haskell. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/noprofits-org/blog).

### Core Technologies
* **Generator**: Hakyll 4.15
* **Language**: Haskell
* **Content Formats**: 
    - Markdown for posts and general content
    - reStructuredText for specialized formatting
    - HTML templates for layout
* **Math & Chemistry**: 
    - MathJax for mathematical notation
    - mhchem for chemical equations
* **Version Control**: Git
* **Hosting**: GitHub Pages

## Features
* LaTeX-style mathematics rendering
* Chemical equation support
* Code syntax highlighting
* Citation management with BibTeX
* Responsive dark theme design

## Development Process
This site was developed in early 2025, starting from Hakyll's default blog template. The development process included:

1. Setting up the Haskell/Hakyll environment
2. Implementing mathematics and chemistry support
3. Customizing the theme and layout
4. Adding citation management
5. Optimizing for performance
